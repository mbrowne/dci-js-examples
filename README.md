DCI examples in Javascript

For an introduction to DCI, see the article:

"Working with objects - in computer and mind"
at http://fulloo.info/Documents/.

These examples are in native Javascript. For a transpilation solution with a dedicated syntax and other improvements specifically for DCI, see [babel-dci](https://github.com/mbrowne/babel-dci).
